            <p class="text">
              The Colosseum is the perfect symbol of the power of the Roman Empire at its height. Dating back to 72 AD,
              it
              was designed to hold 50,000 spectators and was, at the time, the biggest amphitheater ever built. Here,
              all
              manner of public spectacles were shown – from animal hunts and executions to gory gladiator battles; it
              was
              even filled with water for mock sea battles.
              <br>
              <br>
              Although practically a ruin, the Colosseum is still very much an icon of Rome. Step inside the arches and
              take
              a tour of the structure. Sit and imagine yourself as a spectator in Roman times, and the grand displays
              and
              spectacles that went on inside the ring.

              visiting
              the French capital. Constructed between 1887 and 1889, the tower was originally built to be the impressive
              entrance to the 1889 World’s Fair. The tower stands at 324 meters tall and was amazingly the world’s
              tallest
              man-made structure until the Empire State Building took the title in 1930.

              Take the lift all the way to the observation deck of the tower and marvel at the views of the Parisian

            <p class="text">
              The world-famous leaning tower is known around the globe for its incredible four-degree tilt that makes it
              seem as if the tower is about to topple over. The amazing slanted belltower sits behind Pisa Cathedral and
              was
              built in the Romanesque style.
              <br>
              <br>
              Dating back to the 12th century, the tower took a whopping 199 years to complete, but began to slant
              during
              its construction due to soft ground on one side. Today, the tower – which stands at a wonky 55.86 meters
              tall
              – attracts tourists from far and wide who want to catch sight of the tower and snap pictures of themselves
              in
              front of it.

              The Acropolis in Athens is a simply stunning sight. This monumental hill is the location of a number of
              ancient sites that date back to the 5th century BC. Some of the attractions that crown the Acropolis
              include
              the Temple of Athena Nike, the Erechtheion, and, of course, the Parthenon.

              <br>
              <br>
              Constructed at the peak of the Athenian Empire in 447 BC, the Parthenon is a symbol of Greece and
              impresses
              with
              its innumerable columns. Dedicated to Athena, it became a Christian church in the 6th century AD and a
              mosque
              in
              the 1460s after the Ottoman invasion. After nightfall, the Acropolis is lit up with a glow that can be
              seen
              around Athens.

            <p class="text">
              ​
              Built on the ruins of Roman fortifications in 889 AD, Alhambra is a combination palace and fortress
              situated
              in Granada, Spain. For almost 1,000 years, much of the Iberian peninsula was ruled by the Islamic Moors,
              with
              Andalusia (the area where Alhambra is located) being their longest-held territory.
              <br>
              <br>
              Today, you can explore its citadel, the oldest part of the fortress, climb up its watchtower, explore the
              amazing Moorish gardens and courtyards, and be amazed at the delicate geometric patterns throughout the
              complex. The setting on the backdrop of the Sierra Nevada makes Alhambra that much more mystical.

              Bruges
              originally sat on the banks of the river Reie; as the city developed, so did its charming waterways. The

              the town.

              fell from the volcano has led to an incredibly well-preserved snapshot of a Roman city frozen in the midst
              of
              a disaster.
