  <!-- <h3 class="typesOfArt">Prehistoric art</h3>
  <p>Surviving European prehistoric art mainly comprises sculpture and rock art. It includes the oldest known  
    representation of the human body, the Venus of Hohle Fel, dating from 40,000-35,000 BC, found in Schelklingen, 
    Germany and the Löwenmensch figurine, from about 30,000 BC, the oldest undisputed piece of figurative art. The 
    Swimming Reindeer of about 11,000 BCE is among the finest Magdalenian carvings in bone or antler of animals in
    the 
    art of the Upper Paleolithic. At the beginning of the Mesolithic in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced,
    and 
    remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period,
    despite 
    some works such as the Gundestrup cauldron from the European Iron Age and the Bronze Age Trundholm sun chariot.
    The 
    oldest European cave art dates back 40,800[clarification needed] and can be found in the El Castillo Cave in
    Spain, 
    but cave art exists across the continent. Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those 
    paintings have survived because of erosion. One well-known example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi in the 
    Saimaa area of Finland.

  <h3 class="typesOfArt">Classical art</h3>
  <p>Ancient Greek art stands out among that of other ancient cultures for its development of naturalistic but
    idealised 
    depictions of the human body, in which largely nude male figures were generally the focus of innovation. The rate
    of 
    stylistic development between about 750 and 300 BC was remarkable by ancient standards, and in surviving works
    is 
    best seen in Ancient Greek sculpture. There were important innovations in painting, which have to be essentially 
    reconstructed due to the lack of original survivals of quality, other than the distinct field of painted
    pottery. 
    Black-figure pottery and the subsequent red-figure pottery are famous and influential examples of the Ancient
    Greek 
    decorative arts. Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek 
    painting and sculpture, but was also strongly influenced by the more local Etruscan art of Italy. Sculpture was 
    perhaps considered as the highest form of art by Romans, but figure painting was also very highly regarded.
    Roman 
    sculpture is primarily portraiture derived from the upper classes of society as well as depictions of the gods. 
    However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Among surviving Roman paintings are wall 
    paintings, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy, especially at Pompeii and Herculaneum. Such painting
    can 
    be grouped into four main "styles" or periods and may contain the first examples of trompe-l'oeil, 
    pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape. Early Christian art grew out of Roman popular, and later Imperial, art
    and 
    adapted its iconography from these sources.</p>

          <h3 class="typesOfArt">Medieval art
          </h3>
          <p><span class="highlite">Medieval art </span>can be broadly categorised into the Byzantine
            art of the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Gothic
            art that emerged in Western Europe over the same period.
            <br>
            <br>
            Byzantine art was strongly influenced by its <span class="highlite">classical heritage,</span> but
            distinguished itself by the development
            of a new, <span class="highlite">abstract, aesthetic, marked by anti-naturalism and a favour for
              symbolism.</span> The subject matter of
            monumental Byzantine art was primarily religious and imperial: the two themes are often combined, as in
            the
            portraits of later <span class="highlite">Byzantine emperors</span> that decorated the interior of the
            sixth-century church of Hagia
            Sophia
            in <span class="highlite">Constantinople.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            However, the Byzantines inherited the Early Christian distrust of monumental sculpture in
            religious art, and produced only reliefs, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in
            sharp
            contrast to the medieval art of the West, where<span class="highlite"> monumental sculpture</span>
            revived from Carolingian art
            onwards. Small ivories were also mostly in relief.
            <br>
            <br>
            The so-called <span class="highlite">"minor arts"</span> were very important in <span
              class="highlite">Byzantine
              art and luxury items, </span>including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation Consular
            diptychs or caskets
            such as the Veroli casket, hardstone carvings, enamels, glass, jewelry, metalwork, and figured silks
            were
            produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era.</p>
